            <p>
                My journey into web development started with a simple curiosity about how websites work.
                Every time I opened a webpage, I wondered how buttons responded, layouts adjusted, and content appeared
                so beautifully.
            </p>
            <p>
                I began with the basics — <strong>HTML</strong>. It helped me understand the structure of a webpage.
                After that, I moved on to <strong>CSS</strong>, which completely changed how my websites looked.
                Adding colors, layouts, and responsiveness made learning exciting.
            </p>
            <p>
                The real fun began when I started learning <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
                Suddenly, my websites were no longer static — they could respond to user actions, validate forms, and
                animate elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're just starting out, my advice is simple: be consistent, practice daily, and build small
                projects.
                Every line of code you write brings you one step closer to becoming a better developer.
