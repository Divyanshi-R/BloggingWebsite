                JavaScript is the language that brings websites to life.
                While HTML structures a page and CSS styles it, JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the first concepts in JavaScript is <strong>variables</strong>.
                Variables store data like numbers, text, or values entered by users.
                They allow your program to remember and use information when needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Functions</strong> are another core concept.
                A function is a block of code that performs a specific task, such as responding to a button click or
                validating a form.
                Using functions helps keep your code clean and reusable.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript also allows you to interact with HTML using the <strong>DOM (Document Object Model)</strong>.
                This means you can change text, styles, or elements on a page without reloading it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, <strong>event listeners</strong> let JavaScript react to user actions like clicks, typing, or
                scrolling.
                These events make websites interactive and engaging.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mastering JavaScript basics opens the door to advanced topics like animations, APIs, and frameworks.
                Start small, practice daily, and enjoy the process of learning.
