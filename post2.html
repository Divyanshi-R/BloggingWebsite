                A clean user interface makes a website more attractive, readable, and user-friendly.
                Even simple websites can look professional if CSS is used correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most important tips is to maintain proper <strong>spacing</strong>.
                Using consistent margins and padding helps separate content and improves readability.
                Avoid crowding elements too close together.
            </p>
            <p>
                Always use modern layout techniques like <strong>Flexbox</strong> and <strong>CSS Grid</strong>.
                These tools make it easier to align items, create responsive layouts, and adapt designs for different
                screen sizes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Choosing the right <strong>color palette</strong> is another key factor.
                Stick to 2–3 main colors and use soft background shades to reduce eye strain.
                Consistency in colors creates a strong visual identity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, design with a <strong>mobile-first approach</strong>.
                Start styling for smaller screens and then scale up for larger devices.
                This ensures your UI looks clean and functional on all devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                By following these CSS tips, you can transform simple layouts into clean, modern, and
                professional-looking interfaces.
